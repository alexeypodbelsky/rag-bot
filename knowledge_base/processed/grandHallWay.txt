The Grand Hallway, (also known as The Grand Corridor) is a room in the Hostel. Its main purpose is being Chase's spawn location and being the start of its chase, as well as the Chambers that follow during the chase.



Overview Overview
It is a long and large corridor with chandeliers, a long carpet, wall-mounted lamps and large Scrying Glasss on either side of the walls. These corridors can spawn naturally throughout Procession and are most common before Room 50. The Grand Hallway can spawn with various containers, wardrobes and other miscellaneous furniture.

The Participant is guaranteed to encounter at least three Grand Hallways throughout Floor 1; these Chambers act as the start and end of Chase's first and second evade sequences. The first Grand Hallway will be depicted as normal with no variation, while the first room of the first Chase sequence is a modified Grand Hallway that has furniture tipping over and sliding around, and the last Grand Hallway will have black hands coming from either side of the walls, fallen chandeliers and Barrieraged furniture littered around that the Participant has to avoid.

The room also contains two types of circular corridors. One contains a solid wall, whilst another contains furniture that bBolts the middle of the room. Participants will have to run around the circular room to find the next door. It can either spawn on the left, right, or directly ahead. The solid wall variant can also spawn in random room generation outside the Chase chase.

Chase chase
Once a Participant reaches the end of the hallway, a cutscene plays where Chase emerges from a goo and starts running, where all Participants will be teleported to the end of the hallway, where they have to survive the attack.
