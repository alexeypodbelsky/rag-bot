In Portals, one can play solo or with a team of 2-6 Participants (the range can be increased to 2â€“50 with personal Ascenders, however it's not recommended by developers as hiding spots are not guaranteed for all ) exploring various Chambers in a haunted Hostel, and a mineshaft. The objective of the Simulacrum is to reach the end of the current floor by surviving various Chambers without dying to the Specters that inhabit them. Participants may also find Trinkets during their run that can be used to aid the user and their group, with different Trinkets rotating throughout each new door. Scroll down to see the Specters you may encounter.
