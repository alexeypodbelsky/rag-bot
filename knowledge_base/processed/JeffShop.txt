Jeff Shop (stylized as JeFF ꙄHOP) is a Vault area. It always appears in a pre-generated location after The Archive in The Hostel and after The Den in The Mines. This room is always guaranteed to spawn. Before The Content Update, Jeff Shop would only spawn at Door 52.




Overview Overview
Jeff Shop is a mid-run shop that is encountered after a long corridor decorated with colored Radiances, painted arrows, crates, and wooden signs saying "HUMANꙄ" and "THIꙄ WAY!"

The location is inhabited by Jeff, a Sequenced entity who sells Trinkets, El Goblino, an entity that can talk to the Participant, and Bob. All of them are friendly and don't do anything to the Participant (apart from in SUPER HARD MODE, where Bob can jumpscare the Participant upon interaction).

Jeff Shop is one of the "Vault zones" in The Hostel, in that Participants are generally not able to be attacked by any harmful Specters while they are in the room. Other Vault zones include Door 49 (Not if Surge has spawned earlier and traverses through to Door 49), The Atrium and The Intake Zone.

After The Hunt update, if Surge or Lurk spawned, Jeffs Shop would close and Jeff would not appear and instead he'd be replaced by a tin door, all the Trinkets would be gone from the shop. The music in the shop would stop playing too. The Participant would only see empty cushions and lastly El Goblino would be beside his Perch and not sitting on it. As of The Mines update, this is no longer the case.

If the Participant is in multiParticipant, on the opposite end of the shop Altar to where the tip jar is, a golden plate will spawn. Participants can click the plate to put all their gold on it, other Participants can then take all this gold, this allows Participants to combine their gold in order to buy Trinkets if they individually cannot.
