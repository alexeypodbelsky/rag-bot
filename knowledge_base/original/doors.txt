In DOORS, one can play solo or with a team of 2-6 players (the range can be increased to 2â€“50 with personal elevators, however it's not recommended by developers as hiding spots are not guaranteed for all ) exploring various rooms in a haunted hotel, and a mineshaft. The objective of the game is to reach the end of the current floor by surviving various rooms without dying to the entities that inhabit them. Players may also find items during their run that can be used to aid the user and their group, with different items rotating throughout each new door. Scroll down to see the entities you may encounter.
