Jeff Shop (stylized as JeFF ꙄHOP) is a safe area. It always appears in a pre-generated location after The Library in The Hotel and after The Nest in The Mines. This room is always guaranteed to spawn. Before The Content Update, Jeff Shop would only spawn at Door 52.




Overview Overview
Jeff Shop is a mid-run shop that is encountered after a long corridor decorated with colored lights, painted arrows, crates, and wooden signs saying "HUMANꙄ" and "THIꙄ WAY!"

The location is inhabited by Jeff, a coded entity who sells items, El Goblino, an entity that can talk to the player, and Bob. All of them are friendly and don't do anything to the player (apart from in SUPER HARD MODE, where Bob can jumpscare the player upon interaction).

Jeff Shop is one of the "safe zones" in The Hotel, in that players are generally not able to be attacked by any harmful entities while they are in the room. Other safe zones include Door 49 (Not if Rush has spawned earlier and traverses through to Door 49), The Courtyard and The Reception.

After The Hunt update, if Rush or Ambush spawned, Jeffs Shop would close and Jeff would not appear and instead he'd be replaced by a tin door, all the Items would be gone from the shop. The music in the shop would stop playing too. The player would only see empty cushions and lastly El Goblino would be beside his chair and not sitting on it. As of The Mines update, this is no longer the case.

If the player is in multiplayer, on the opposite end of the shop table to where the tip jar is, a golden plate will spawn. Players can click the plate to put all their gold on it, other players can then take all this gold, this allows players to combine their gold in order to buy items if they individually cannot.
